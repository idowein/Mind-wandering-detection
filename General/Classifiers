Facial expressions as indicators for MW (Mind Wandering): 
Blinking: Frequent or irregular blinking can indicate mind-wandering or lack of attention.
Eyebrow Contractions: Tension in the eyebrows, such as furrowing, can be associated with confusion or disengagement.
Cheek Raising: Changes in the cheek area, either through smiling or tensing, can indicate emotional shifts or changes in focus.
Facial Twitching: Involuntary facial twitches, especially around the eyes or lips, can signal cognitive overload or distraction.
Yawning: A common sign of fatigue or disinterest, yawning is an important indicator of disengagement.
Smiling: A genuine or spontaneous smile might signal moments of attention or engagement in a positive way.
Frowning: Frowning or pursing lips can indicate frustration or confusion, common during loss of attention.
Looking Away: Shifts in gaze direction, where a person looks away from the screen or task at hand, are strong indicators of mind-wandering.

write that in a way that it could get in my github has a text: **Introduction**

Mind wandering is a common cognitive phenomenon where attention shifts away from a primary task toward internal thoughts or feelings. The level of involvement or engagement in a task is often inversely related to the frequency of mind wandering episodes. Below are ten research articles that explore the connection between level of involvement and mind wandering.

1. **Kane, M. J., & McVay, J. C. (2012).** What mind wandering reveals about executive-control abilities and failures. *Current Directions in Psychological Science*, 21(5), 348-354. https://doi.org/10.1177/0963721412454875

   **Conclusion:** This study suggests that individuals with higher executive control abilities are better at maintaining task engagement, leading to reduced mind wandering. It highlights that lower involvement in a task correlates with increased mind wandering episodes due to lapses in executive control.

2. **Smallwood, J., & Schooler, J. W. (2015).** The science of mind wandering: Empirically navigating the stream of consciousness. *Annual Review of Psychology*, 66, 487-518. https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-psych-010814-015331

   **Conclusion:** The review emphasizes that mind wandering occurs more frequently during tasks that require less cognitive engagement. It underscores that higher levels of involvement decrease the propensity for the mind to drift away from the task at hand.

3. **Unsworth, N., & McMillan, B. D. (2013).** Mind wandering and reading comprehension: Examining the roles of working memory capacity, interest, motivation, and topic experience. *Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition*, 39(3), 832-842. https://doi.org/10.1037/a0029669

   **Conclusion:** The study finds that increased interest and motivation in reading materials enhance engagement levels, which in turn reduce mind wandering. It demonstrates that personal involvement with the content mitigates attentional lapses.

4. **Robison, M. K., Miller, A. L., & Unsworth, N. (2020).** Examining the effects of mind wandering propensity and working memory capacity on baseline pupil diameter and variability. *Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience*, 32(8), 1515-1527. https://doi.org/10.1162/jocn_a_01559

   **Conclusion:** This research indicates that individuals with a higher propensity for mind wandering exhibit greater baseline pupil diameter variability, suggesting lower levels of task engagement. It highlights the physiological markers associated with involvement and attentional control.

5. **Seli, P., Risko, E. F., & Smilek, D. (2016).** On the necessity of distinguishing between unintentional and intentional mind wandering. *Psychological Science*, 27(5), 685-691. https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797616634068

   **Conclusion:** The authors argue that unintentional mind wandering is more disruptive to task performance than intentional mind wandering. Higher task involvement reduces unintentional mind wandering by keeping attention anchored to the task.

6. **Wang, Y., Reimer, M. A., & Alexopoulos, G. S. (2019).** Mind wandering in older adults: The role of executive control and prospective memory. *The Journals of Gerontology: Series B*, 74(7), 1134-1142. https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbx169

   **Conclusion:** The study demonstrates that older adults with better executive control exhibit higher levels of task involvement and less mind wandering. It suggests that maintaining engagement is crucial for reducing cognitive distractions in aging populations.

7. **Szpunar, K. K., Moulton, S. T., & Schacter, D. L. (2013).** Mind wandering and education: From the classroom to online learning. *Frontiers in Psychology*, 4, 495. https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00495

   **Conclusion:** This article discusses how increased engagement in educational settings reduces mind wandering. It highlights strategies like interactive content to enhance student involvement and minimize attentional lapses.

8. **Ralph, B. C., Thomson, D. R., Cheyne, J. A., & Smilek, D. (2014).** Media multitasking and behavioral measures of sustained attention. *Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics*, 76(4), 1056-1068. https://doi.org/10.3758/s13414-014-0631-3

   **Conclusion:** The research finds that individuals who frequently multitask media exhibit lower levels of task involvement and higher rates of mind wandering. It suggests that habitual multitasking can undermine the ability to stay engaged.

9. **Esterman, M., Noonan, S. K., Rosenberg, M., & DeGutis, J. (2013).** In the zone or zoning out? Tracking behavioral and neural fluctuations during sustained attention. *Cerebral Cortex*, 23(11), 2712-2723. https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhs261

   **Conclusion:** This study shows that fluctuations in sustained attention are linked to varying levels of involvement. When participants are highly engaged, mind wandering decreases, indicating a direct connection between the two.

10. **Mrazek, M. D., Smallwood, J., & Schooler, J. W. (2012).** Mindfulness training improves working memory capacity and GRE performance while reducing mind wandering. *Psychological Science*, 23(8), 776-781. https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797611437116

    **Conclusion:** The authors demonstrate that mindfulness training enhances task involvement and reduces mind wandering. Improved engagement leads to better cognitive performance, highlighting the importance of maintaining focus.

**Overall Conclusion**

The collected research consistently indicates a strong inverse relationship between the level of involvement in a task and the frequency of mind wandering. Higher engagement leads to reduced mind wandering episodes, improving overall task performance and cognitive functioning. Strategies to enhance involvement, such as increasing task interest, motivation, and utilizing mindfulness techniques, are effective in mitigating mind wandering and its associated negative impacts.

You want to create a new CSV file with two labels:

1: Engagement
2: Non-Engagement
For each row, you want to:

Sum the levels of boredom, confusion, and frustration.
If the sum of boredom + confusion + frustration is greater than the engagement level, label the row as 2 (Non-Engagement).
If the engagement level is greater than the sum of the other three levels, label the row as 1 (Engagement).
I will provide you with a Python script that performs this operation and generates a new CSV file with the desired labels.

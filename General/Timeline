Timeline: 
1. Analyzing one video
- lableling manually DAiSEE dataset for facial expressions classifiers.
- using ROC graph for treshold optimization.
2. Running the code over the original dataset 
- creating csv that contains model classifiers for each video. 
- using random forest in order to train the model
3. Measuring and calculating model success.
- using correlation matrix via pandas, F1 and etc.

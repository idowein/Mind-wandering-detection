Facial expressions as indicators for MW (Mind Wandering): 
Blinking: Frequent or irregular blinking can indicate mind-wandering or lack of attention.
Eyebrow Contractions: Tension in the eyebrows, such as furrowing, can be associated with confusion or disengagement.
Cheek Raising: Changes in the cheek area, either through smiling or tensing, can indicate emotional shifts or changes in focus.
Facial Twitching: Involuntary facial twitches, especially around the eyes or lips, can signal cognitive overload or distraction.
Yawning: A common sign of fatigue or disinterest, yawning is an important indicator of disengagement.
Smiling: A genuine or spontaneous smile might signal moments of attention or engagement in a positive way.
Frowning: Frowning or pursing lips can indicate frustration or confusion, common during loss of attention.
Looking Away: Shifts in gaze direction, where a person looks away from the screen or task at hand, are strong indicators of mind-wandering.

  - This paper shows that cheek raising, associated with certain expressions, can indicate emotional disengagement, which may align with mind-wandering.

  - This study links specific facial movements, like twitching, to physiological and cognitive changes, often related to disengagement from external tasks.

5. Yawning

  - Yawning is connected to cognitive disengagement and mind-wandering in this study, with yawns serving as a signal for shifts in mental focus.

- Guggisberg, A. G., Mathis, J., Schnider, A., & Hess, C. W. (2007). Why do we yawn? The importance of evidence for theories on the function of yawning. *Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews, 31*(6), 157-164. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2007.02.002  
  - Yawning is explored as a physiological indicator of transitions in cognitive states, such as entering mind-wandering phases.

6. Smiling
